# 🚀 Nate Protocol Quickstart Guide

Welcome to the Nate Protocol. This guide will help you participate in the world's first human-capital-backed prediction market.

## 1. Connect Your Wallet
- Navigate to the [Nate Market UI](http://localhost:5173).
- Ensure your wallet is set to **Sepolia Testnet**.
- Click **CONNECT WALLET** in the top right.

## 2. Get $NATE Tokens
To participate in the market, you need $NATE. You can obtain it in two ways:
- **Direct Minting**: Use the Stability Engine to mint $NATE against protocol collateral. 
- **Airdrops/Grants**: In the testnet phase, you may receive tokens for testing.

> [!NOTE]
> Minting incurs a **0.5% protocol fee**.

## 3. Place Your Bets
- Browse the **Active Markets**. These are real-world tasks or milestones.
- Click **BET YES** if you believe the goal will be achieved, or **BET NO** if you're skeptical.
- Enter the amount of $NATE you wish to stake.
- **Confirm** the transaction in your wallet.

## 4. Claim Winnings
Once a task is resolved:
- If you backed the correct side, you can claim your share of the total pool.
- The protocol takes a **2% rake** from the pool before distribution.
- Click **CLAIM REWARD** on the resolved card to receive your $NATE.

## 5. Exit to ETH
- If you want to convert your $NATE back to ETH, use the **Redeem** function in the Stability Engine.
- Redemptions occur at a $1.00 USD peg.
- **Redemption Fee**: 0.5% protocol toll.
